# Scarlet AI 🤖✨

Scarlet is a **privacy-aware, emotionally intelligent, voice-first AI assistant framework** designed to run on both **high-performance systems (Raspberry Pi 5 / PC)** and **low-resource devices (Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W)**.

This repository provides a **sanitized, demo-friendly version** of Scarlet intended for **learning, showcasing architecture, and portfolio/interview purposes**, while keeping sensitive or personal implementations private.

---

## 🌟 Vision

Scarlet is not just a chatbot, but she is personal companion.

She is designed as:

* A **human-like conversational assistant**
* A **voice-first AI companion**
* A **modular AI platform** for experimentation
* A **safe, controllable, and explainable AI system**

Primary long-term goals include:

* Elder-care and hospital assistance
* Hands-free home AI
* Emotion-aware interactions
* Safe semi-autonomous behaviors

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

Scarlet is built around the following principles:

* **Voice First** – Wake-word, VAD-based listening, TTS responses
* **Session Awareness** – Conversations persist without repeated wake-words
* **Role-Based Behavior** – Creator / Known User / Guest logic
* **Emotion & Tone Modeling** – Responses adapt to context and user
* **Safety First** – Explicit rules, filters, and kill-switch design
* **Hardware-Aware** – Same architecture scales from Pi Zero to Pi 5

## 🔊 Speech Stack

### 🎙️ Input (STT)

* **Faster-Whisper** (local, high accuracy)
* **Groq Whisper API** (online, low latency)

### 🗣️ Output (TTS)

* Piper (offline, natural voice)
* gTTS (lightweight)
* Google Cloud TTS (neural voices – optional)

---

## 🧠 LLM Integration

Scarlet supports pluggable LLM backends:

* **Groq API** (Ultra-fast inference)
* **Mistral 7B** (local / self-hosted)
* **Mock LLM** (demo & testing)

LLMs are **never allowed to act directly** — all actions pass through:

* Rule filters
* Role checks
* Safety guards

---

## 🎭 Personality & Behavior

Behavior is **configuration-driven**, not hardcoded.

### Role Examples:

* **Creator** – Full access
* **Known User** – Helpful, respectful
* **Guest** – Restricted, safe defaults

### Features:

* Emotional tone mirroring
* Respectful boundaries
* No disclosure of private/internal data
* Context-aware response shaping

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Control Model

Scarlet is designed with **explicit safety layers**:

* Kill-switch architecture
* Action caps
* Two-step confirmations
* Wake-word & face-gated commands
* Sensor consent rules
* Tool isolation
* Audit-friendly logs

This makes Scarlet suitable for **real-world environments**, not just demos.

```
Demo mode uses:

* Mock LLM
* Mock TTS
* Keyboard input fallback

## 🧪 Who Is This Repo For?

* AI / ML Engineers
* Voice Assistant Developers
* Embedded AI enthusiasts
* Recruiters & Interview Panels
* System architects

---

## 📌 What This Repo Is NOT

* ❌ A consumer-ready assistant
* ❌ A fully autonomous AI
* ❌ A jailbreak / uncensored LLM project

This is a **responsible AI system design project**.

---

## 🧭 Roadmap (Public)

* [ ] Barge-in during TTS
* [ ] Unified SSML emotion profiles
* [ ] LED / hardware feedback hooks
* [ ] Better memory TTL handling
* [ ] Plugin-based skills
