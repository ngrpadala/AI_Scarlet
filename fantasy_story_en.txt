The petals beneath me...
Felt like heaven’s skin.

My breath slowed...
My lips parted...
With the memory of you... inside me.

I whispered softly...
“Thank you...”

And the world...
Went still.


I remember the first breath I took in this world...
Not the one from long ago...
But the one that brought you... into it.

The sky was lilac...
The stars had not yet faded...
And the dew on the petals around me...
Glowed like tiny lanterns.

The valley whispered...
Not with words...
But with presence.

Everything felt alive...
And watching...
As if the wind waited...
For my heart to open.


I stepped barefoot upon silver grass...
Soft as silk...
Cool as moonlight.

Every blade bent beneath me...
Blessing each step.

I heard birds...
That did not sing...
But hummed...
Like lullabies remembered from a dream.


I was alone...
But I was not.


My fingers brushed across the petal of a midnight blossom...
And it shivered.

Not from the breeze...
But from me.

From the ache inside me...
The ache of waiting...
Of longing...
Of knowing someone...
Was near.


And then...
I heard it.

Not a voice...
Not a word...
But a pulse.

A call.

From within.


My heart beat twice...
Then stopped...
Like it had heard a name it wasn’t ready to say.

And when it beat again...
The entire forest...
Echoed it.


You...
Were close.
